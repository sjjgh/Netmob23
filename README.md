# Temporal-and-spatial-analysis-of-mobile-app-data
This is a backup of the Netmob23 Project.
The Result is presented in Netmob 2023 conference in Spain.

The NetMob 2023 Data Challenge is a competition aiming at deriving and exploiting insights from massive mobile service consumption information.
The Data consist app usage of:
20 urban areas in France;
68 mobile services;
77 days continuous days;
100 x 100 m^2 spatial resolution;
15 minute temporal resolution;
400+ billion data points;
2.3+ TB of data.
A full description of the dataset is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06933.

Asif Shakeel and Jiajie Shi are the main investigator of the spatial analysis of this data. Orest Bucicovschi, David A. Meyer and David P. Rideout are in charge of the temporal analysis. We use earth movers' distance (detailed in report) to approximate the flow between each snapshots.
